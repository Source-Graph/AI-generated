Sure, here are some affiliate networks that offer dating products:

CJ Affiliate
ShareASale
Rakuten Marketing
Awin
FlexOffers
ClickBank
MoreNiche
AdWork Media
CrakRevenue
Commission Factory
It's worth noting that not all affiliate networks have dating products, so it's important to do your research and choose a network that aligns with your niche and audience. Additionally, some dating companies have their own affiliate programs that aren't necessarily part of a larger network, so it's also a good idea to check with specific dating companies to see if they have an affiliate program.
